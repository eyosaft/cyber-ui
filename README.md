## Syntax highlighting

[`rehype-highlight`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-highlight).

```py {5-6, 8} showLineNumbers
def factorial(x):
    """This is a recursive function
    to find the factorial of an integer"""

    if x == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return (x * factorial(x-1))
```
